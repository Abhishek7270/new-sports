            Virat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation: [ʋɪˈɾɑːʈ ˈkoːɦli] ⓘ; born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer who
            plays Test and ODI cricket for the Indian national team. A former captain in all formats of the game, Kohli retired from
            the T20I format following India's win at the 2024 T20 World Cup. He's a right-handed batsman and an occasional
            unorthodox right arm quick bowler. Kohli holds the highest IPL run-scorer record, ranks third in T20I, third in ODI, and
            stands the fourth-highest in international cricket.[4] Regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time, he also
            holds the record for scoring the most centuries in ODI cricket and is second in the list of most international centuries
            scored in international cricket.[5]
            
            Kohli was a member of the Indian team that won the 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup, 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2013
            Champions Trophy and 2024 T20 World Cup and also captained India to win the ICC Test mace three consecutive times in
            2017, 2018, and 2019.[6] He represents Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the Indian Premier League and Delhi in domestic
            cricket.
            
            In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ODI batsmen ICC rankings. In 2015, he also achieved the same for T20I
            rankings.[7] In 2018, he was ranked the top Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one
            spot in all three formats. He is the first player to score 20,000 runs in a decade. In 2020, the ICC named him the male
            cricketer of the decade.[8]
            
            Kohli has garnered 10 ICC Awards making him the most awarded player in International Cricket history. He won the ICC ODI
            Player of the Year award four times in 2012, 2017, 2018, and 2023. He also won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, given to
            the ICC Cricketer of the Year, on two occasions, in 2017 and 2018 respectively. In 2018, he became the first player to
            win both ICC ODI and Test Player of the Year awards in the same year. Also, he was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in
            the World for three consecutive years, from 2016 to 2018. Kohli has the most Player of the Series awards and second most
            Player of the Match awards to his name in all three formats combined. He was honoured with the Arjuna Award in 2013, the
            Padma Shri in 2017, and India's highest sporting honour, the Khel Ratna Award, in 2018. In 2018, Time magazine included
            him on its list of the 100 most influential people in the world.
            
            After winning the 2024 T20 World Cup and the Player of the Match in the Final, Kohli announced his retirement from
            T20Is.[9]

            Jasprit Jasbirsingh Bumrah (Punjabi: [dʒəsˈpɾiːt̪ bʊmˈɾaː]; born 6 December 1993) is an Indian international cricketer
            who plays for the Indian national cricket team in all formats of the game. He is the vice-captain of India in Test
            format. A right-arm fast bowler with a unique bowling action, Bumrah plays for Gujarat in domestic cricket and for
            Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League. Bumrah was a crucial member of the Indian team that won the 2024 T20 World
            Cup, where he was named the player of the tournament for his wicket taking in all phases while maintaining an economy of
            4.17.
            
            Among Indian fast bowlers, he took 200 wickets in the fewest matches and reached 100 wickets in ODI cricket in the
            second-shortest time (in terms of matches played). He is the first bowler to have achieved the number one ranking in the
            ICC men's player rankings in all three formats of the game. He also holds the record of scoring the highest number of
            runs in an over in Test cricket. He achieved this feat against Stuart Broad.
            
            Bumrah made his domestic debut in 2012–13 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and also helped his side clinch its maiden title
            victory. His first-class debut came against Vidarbha, during the 2013–14 season of the Ranji Trophy. Bumrah was signed
            by the Mumbai Indians for the 2013 season of IPL. Since then, he has played for MI, contributing to the team's title
            wins five times. He is the second-highest wicket-taker for MI, behind Lasith Malinga, with 165 wickets in 133 matches
