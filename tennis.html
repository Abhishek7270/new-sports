            Roger Federer (/ˈfɛdərər/ FED-ər-ər, Swiss Standard German: [ˈrɔdʒər ˈfeːdərər]; born 8 August 1981) is a Swiss former
            professional tennis player. He was ranked world No. 1 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for
            310 weeks, including a record 237 consecutive weeks, and finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. He won 103 singles
            titles on the ATP Tour, the second most since the start of the Open Era in 1968, including 20 major men's singles titles
            (among which a record eight men's singles Wimbledon titles, and an Open Era joint-record five men's singles US Open
            titles) and six year-end championships.
            
            A Wimbledon junior champion in 1998 and former ball boy, Federer won his first major singles title at Wimbledon in 2003
            at age 21.[3] Between 2003 and 2009, Federer played in 21 out of 28 major singles finals. He won three of the four
            majors and the ATP Finals[a] in 2004, 2006, and 2007 as well as five consecutive titles at both Wimbledon and the US
            Open. He completed the career Grand Slam at the 2009 French Open after three consecutive runner-up finishes to Rafael
            Nadal, his main rival until 2010. At age 27, he surpassed Pete Sampras's record of 14 major men's singles titles at
            Wimbledon in 2009.
            
            Federer and Stan Wawrinka led the Switzerland Davis Cup team to their first title in 2014, following their Olympic
            doubles gold victory at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Federer also won a silver medal in singles at the 2012 London
            Olympics, finishing runner-up to Andy Murray. After a half-year hiatus in late 2016 to recover from knee surgery,
            Federer returned to tennis, winning three more majors over the next two years, including the 2017 Australian Open over
            Nadal and an eighth singles title at the 2017 Wimbledon Championships. At the 2018 Australian Open, Federer became the
            first man to win 20 major singles titles and shortly after the oldest ATP world No. 1 at the time, at age 36. In
            September 2022, he retired from professional tennis following the Laver Cup.

            Novak Djokovic (Serbian: Новак Ђоковић, Novak Đoković, pronounced [nôvaːk dʑôːkovitɕ] ⓘ;[7] born 22 May 1987) is a
            Serbian professional tennis player. He has been ranked No. 1 for a record total of 428 weeks in a record 13 different
            years by the ATP, and finished as the year-end No. 1 a record eight times.[8] Djokovic has won a record 24 Grand Slam
            men's singles titles, including a record ten Australian Open titles. Overall, he has won 99 singles titles, including a
            record 72 Big Titles: 24 majors, a record 40 Masters, a record seven year-end championships, and an Olympic gold medal.
            Djokovic is the only man in tennis history to be the reigning champion of all four majors at once across three different
            surfaces. In singles, he is the only man to achieve a triple Career Grand Slam, and the only player to complete a Career
            Golden Masters, a feat he has accomplished twice. Djokovic is the only player in singles to have won all of the Big
            Titles over the course of his career, having completed the Career Super Slam as part of that accomplishment.
            
            Djokovic began his professional career in 2003. In 2008, at age 20, he disrupted Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal's streak
            of 11 consecutive majors by winning his first major title at the Australian Open. By 2010, Djokovic had begun to
            separate himself from the rest of the field and, as a result, the trio of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic was referred to as
            the "Big Three" among fans and commentators. In 2011, Djokovic ascended to No. 1 for the first time, winning three
            majors and a then-record five Masters titles while going 10–1 against Nadal and Federer. He remained the most successful
            player in men's tennis for the rest of the decade.[9] In 2015, Djokovic had his most successful season, reaching a
            single-season record 15 consecutive finals, winning a season-record 10 Big Titles while having a record 31 victories
            over the top-10 players.[10] His dominant run extended through to the 2016 French Open, where he completed his first
            Career Grand Slam and a non-calendar year Grand Slam, becoming the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four
            majors simultaneously and setting a rankings points record of 16,950.
            
            In 2017, Djokovic suffered from an elbow injury that weakened his results until the 2018 Wimbledon Championships, where
            he won the title while ranked No. 21 in the world. Djokovic has continued to be a dominant force on the tour since then,
            winning 12 major titles and completing his second and third Career Grand Slams. Due to his opposition to COVID-19
            vaccine, Djokovic was forced to skip many tournaments in 2022,[11] notably the Australian Open and the US Open; two
            major events he was the favorite to win.[12][13] One year after the Australian visa controversy, Djokovic made a
            successful comeback to reclaim the 2023 Australian Open trophy,[14] and shortly after he claimed the French Open to take
            the outright record for most men's singles majors won in history.[15] In 2024, he became the oldest gold medalist in
            men's tennis singles history at the Paris Olympics.
            
            Representing Serbia, Djokovic led the national tennis team to its first Davis Cup title in 2010, and the inaugural ATP
            Cup title in 2020. In singles, he won the gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics and the bronze medal at the 2008 Beijing
            Olympics. He is a recipient of the Order of Karađorđe Star, Order of St. Sava, and the Order of the Republika Srpska.
